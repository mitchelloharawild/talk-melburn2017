# MelbURN2017: Analysing sub-daily time series data

Slides and notes for a talk at the 2017 Melbourne Users of R Network (12th October 2017)
in Melbourne, Australia.

#### Abstract

Time series analysis used to involve annual, quarterly and monthly data. Now it increasingly involves daily, hourly, or even more frequent observations. However, the available tools have not kept pace with the needs of analysts, and often we end up trying to use inappropriate tools to visualize, forecast and analyse time series.

In response to this need, my students and I have been working on some new tools to help with analysing modern high-frequency time series. We will discuss some new R packages for managing time series objects, visualizing time series and forecasting time series. Our focus is on hourly and half-hourly data, although the tools are general enough to handle a much wider range of frequencies.

We will introduce tsibbles (tibbles for time series), demonstrate some cool new calendar-based graphics, and show off our new FASST forecasting model.
